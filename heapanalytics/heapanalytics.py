"""
A module for using the HeapAnalytics Server-Side API (https://heapanalytics.com/docs/server-side)
The heapanalytics package allows you to easily track events and update user properties from your python application.

The HeapAnalytics class is the primary class for tracking events and sending user updates.


from heapanalytics import HeapAnalytics

app_id = "XXXXXXXXXX"
heap = HeapAnalytics(app_id)

# Send an event
heap.track('12345', 'Welcome email sent', {'Email': 'john@example.com'})

# Update user profile
heap.identify(
    '12345',
    {
        'First name': 'John',
        'Last name': 'Smith',
    }
)

        Creates a new Heap Analytics object, which can be used for all tracking.

        app_id: the app_id corresponding to one of your projects.
        consumer: (optional) the consumer used to actually send the request. Default: consumer.Consumer

        Using a consumer ensures that the responsibility of actually sending the request is not included in this class and can therefore be changed.
        For example, batch sending if Heap Analytics supports it one day, asynchronous sending, etc.
